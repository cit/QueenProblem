# Queen Problem Solver

This is a Java program that solves the Queen Problem, which involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. The program uses a recursive permutation algorithm to generate all possible solutions and checks for diagonal rule violations.

## How it Works

The program works by generating all possible permutations of the integers from 0 to N-1. Each permutation represents a possible arrangement of queens on the chessboard. The `permute` function recursively generates these permutations and checks for diagonal rule violations using the `checkDiagonalRuleViolation` function.

If a permutation satisfies the diagonal rule, it is considered a valid solution and printed to the console.

## Getting Started

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the source code from the repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the source code files are located.
4. Compile the Java file by running the following command:
```
javac QueenProblem.java
```
5. Run the compiled program with the following command:
```
java QueenProblem
```

## Customization

You can customize the program by modifying the following variables:

- `n`: The number of queens to be placed on the chessboard. You can change this value in the `main` function.

## Example Output

Here is an example output generated by the program when `n` is set to 4:
```
[2, 0, 3, 1]
[1, 3, 0, 2]
```
Each line represents a valid solution, where the numbers correspond to the column positions of the queens on the chessboard.
